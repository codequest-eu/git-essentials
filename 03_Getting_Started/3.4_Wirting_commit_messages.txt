Commit message best practices
    - short single-line summary (less than 50 characters)
    - optionally followed by a blank line and a more complete description
    - keep each line to less than 72 characters
    - write commit messages in present tense, not past tense
        "fix bug" or "fixes bug" not "fixed bug"
    - bullet points are usually asteriks or hyphens
    - can add "ticket tracking numbers" from bugs or support requests
    - can develop shorthand for your organization
        - "[css,js]"
        - "bugfix: "
        - "#38405 -"
    - be clear and descriptive
        - Bad: "fix typo"
        - Good: "Add missing > in project section of HTML"
        - Bad: "Update login code"
        - Good: "Change user authentication to use Blowfish"
        - Bad: "Updates member report, we should discuss if this is right next week"
    - t23094 - Fixes bug in admin logout

    When an admin logged out of the admin area, they could not log in to the members area because their session[:user_id]
    was still set to the admin ID. This patch fixes the bug by setting session[:user_id] to nil when any user logs out of any area.
